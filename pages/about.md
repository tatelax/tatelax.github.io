👋

I'm Tate McCormick, a software developer mostly focused on Unity, C#, and all aspects of software engineering and computer science.

I've been working with Unity since 2010 and have been fortunate enough to be a part of projects ranging from small mobile apps to large scale multi-year enterprise programs.

On this website, you'll find links to some of the projects I've been part of as well as blog posts about various topics and links to helpful resources that I update from time to time.
