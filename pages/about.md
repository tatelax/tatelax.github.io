👋

I'm Tate McCormick, a self-taught software developer with a background in Unity, C#, and all aspects of software engineering and computer science that I find interesting.

I've been working with Unity since 2010 and have been fortunate enough to have been a part of projects ranging from small mobile apps to large scale multi-year enterprise programs working with people from different backgrounds all around the world, sometimes in-person and sometimes remotely.

On this website, you'll find links to some of the projects I've been part of as well as blog posts about various topics and links to helpful resources that I update from time to time.
