Hi,

I'm a software developer primarily focused on Unity and C#. I've been working with Unity since 2010 and have been part of projects ranging from small mobile apps to large multi-year enterprise programs.. 

On my website, you'll find links to some of the projects I've been part of as well as blog posts about various topics and links to helpful resources that I update from time to time.
