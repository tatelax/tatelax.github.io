title: üîó Interesting Links
date-updated: 10-13-2021
---

Over the years, I've been building a repository of interesting or useful links. I decided to add some of them here as they might also be interesting or useful to you. I will periodically update this page as I see fit.

*Note: I've added some of these pages to archive.org to hopefully keep them alive even if the original page goes offline. **You may want to visit the pages directly to decrease loading time.***

[Here's the Markdown file for this page. PRs welcomed!](https://github.com/tatelax/tatelax.github.io/blob/master/pages/links.md)
