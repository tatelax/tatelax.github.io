This website was built using GitHub pages and Jekyll.

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)  are a way of creating a free website from a GitHub repository.

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is basically a code generator that generates your website's from Markdown files.

GitHub has a direct relationship with Jekyll. When you use Jekyll for your GitHub Page, GitHub will automatically run Jekyll on their end to produce the code for your website.

## How

[Here's the full instructions for how to use Jekyll and GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll).

You'll run Jekyll locally on your machine when you develop your site. It acts as a localhost web server that automatically refreshes when you make changes to the code.

When you make a change, just commit and push to your repo as you would normally and GitHub will automatically refresh your site within about 30 seconds.

## Themes

[Here's](https://jekyllthemes.io/) a link to a website were you can find themes. [This](https://riggraz.dev/no-style-please/) is the theme I started with for my website which I heavily modified to my liking.
