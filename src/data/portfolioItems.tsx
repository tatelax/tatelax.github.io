## 💡 About

Sandboxr was one of the first companies that allowed anyone to create a 3D printed figurine of their favorite character from their favorite game. It was one of the very first professional freelance projects I ever worked on back in 2011.

I met with the original co-founders of Sandboxr who were interested in developing a prototype for their idea using the Unity web player. It allowed users to select models and customize the appearance to exactly how they wanted, then place their order and within a week their 3D model would be delivered to their door.

[Sandboxr was aquired by WhiteClouds in 2016.](https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/whiteclouds-announces-acquisition-sandboxr-90680/){:target="\_blank"}

## 💡 About

During my time at [Process Research & Optimization (PRO)](https://processreopt.com/){:target="\_blank"}, I learned more about how large organizations struggle to maintain efficiency and how some of those inefficiencies can be solved.

I worked with various companies to help them understand their internal processes and how they can improve those processes to save time and money.

## 🔥 Problem

We used a variety of tools, such as [Signavio](https://www.signavio.com/){:target="\_blank"} to model a process from end-to-end, using BPMN, and run simulations to help clients understand where bottlenecks were occuring in their businesses processes. The problem with these tools, at the time, was they could not process the volume we wanted to simulate. Our clients had millions of transactions per year and the existing were unable to handle that level of volume. We also had several ideas to improve the visual aspect of these simulations to better understand what was happening and what all of the data actually meant.

## 🔧 Solution

I created a tool in Unity which allowed our consultants to model a business process and run 10x the number of transactions that the existing tools were able to handle. The tool also had additional features, such as being able to control the speed of the simulation which was useful for marketing purposes and allowed company stakeholders to better communicate ideas to clients. Another benefit to this tool was it's deterministic nature. Each simulation was able to output the same results each and every time whereas existing tools could vary as much as **50%** between simulations with the exact same data.

## 💡 About
EmergeNYC is an online game that allows players to play as firefighters in FDNY. The game is set in New York City and has a variety of gamemodes. It has thousands of players and has been features by many top YouTubers and Twitch streamers with millions of views.

I joined the team to assist with adding new gameplay features as well as optimizing framerate. After I joined the team, ratings improved from Mostly Negative to Very Positive.

## 💡 About

When I first joined Walmart as a Senior Software Engineer, I joined the team working on a product called "Associate Use Case" (AUC).

This is a tool we developed and tested in-store that helped associates fulfill pick-up orders. We built custom software that allowed us to author a digital twin of the entire store. This enabled us to perform navigation to help the associate find products in the store as if they had a GPS guiding them. We also used custom product recognition software to ensure that the product the associate was picking off the shelf was correct.

This tool helped improve efficiency by 20% but due to hardware costs and limitations at the time, it was not feasible for a large scale roll out.

This is our first rough prototype where we demonstrated the ability to navigate a user through the store over several aisle distances. Note that AR tracking in recordings is not as smooth as what the headset wearer sees.

## 💡 About

At Walmart, we had a constant need to show-off our work to stakeholders.

The problem is that showing Mixed Reality content to others is actually pretty difficult. There's nothing like wearing a headset but that requires traveling to a location, in our case, putting the headset on, and hoping for the best.

To solve this, I created a way for us to professionally capture MR content in 4k @ 60fps.

We created a 3D printed bracket that allowed a Magic Leap 2 to sit on top of a Sony FX3. The Magic Leap anchored to an ArUco marker located near the shooting location and began transmitting telemetry to a laptop that was running the app we wanted to shoot.

The app was running inside the Unity editor which had a custom package installed that would emulate the user. This worked in all of our existing apps without needing any retrofitting. We were able to just drag and drop a prefab into the scene.

Then we were able to use OBS to layer the feed from the Sony FX3 on top of the output from the Unity editor. We also had an output from OBS to the monitor on the camera, allowing the cinematographer to see what he was shooting.

The ability for the cinematographer to see in real-time 4k what he was shooting enabled him to get more creative with the shoot, and understand if he's capturing what he wants in the video.

## 💡 About

This was a 5 day hackathon project I did while working at Walmart's research division, Store. no. 8. Alongside 3 others, we built and tested in-store an app for the Magic Leap 2 that allowed users to chat with an LLM to help them choose and locate products in store.

The user provided context to the LLM about their dietary goals and restrictions. The LLM was then able to make suggestions to the user about what products to buy and where to find them. We then used Vuforia for object recognition to highlight the product on the shelf for the user and tracked AR to display relevant information to the user directly on the product itself.

## 📖 Context

Many times, we wanted to show off prototypes or MVPs that were still in the process of undergoing UX refinement. Also, we often needed to demonstrate to a group of people in a room what a headset wearer was seeing. With this tool, we were able to show a room of people what a user was doing by letting them hold the iPad, or by using Screen Mirroring on the iPad to stream what the user was seeing via Zoom.

## 👀 Dual Perspectives

Spectator View supports both 3rd and 1st person. This means we can see exactly what a user is seeing from their perspective, or we can switch to 3rd person and have a look around the scene. For example, some products required the user to interact with elements that were behind them. With 3rd person, we could look around the world and find elements that the user hadn't found yet. Also, with the laser pointer feature we can point exactly at a particular element we want the user to look at.

## 💡 About

Melo is a prototype I created to see what a "Figma for XR" tool could look like.

We took some inspiration from work done at my past job at Walmart to see how a user could prototype a tool that let's users visualize what a retail store could look like. Major retailers are already doing this, but in huge warehouses that are difficult to rearrange. XR makes it so 1 person could do this job in minutes instead of hours and they could even do it from the comfort of their own home if they wanted to.

## 💡 About

A problem I've experienced on every software project I've ever been on was that we were in a constant battle to make sure we understood our user.

Does our target audience like our product?
Do they find it useful?
Do they like the design?
Do they understand the UX?

Companies spend millions of dollars every year trying to get answers to these questions. And it always happens after a product has been designed and at least prototyped by an engineer. That means you're making guesses all along the way to the answers of the above questions.

I wanted to see if AI could give companies some of these answers much sooner. And the answer is, yes...

I created a rough mockup in an hour for what the UI could look like.

Pace is a social habit building app.

It enables you to build and maintain habits by using your friends, family, coworkers, whoever you want to help hold each other accountable.

Create a group, invite your friends, and set how many times per week everyone should check-in. Check-ins are done by taking a photo that proves you actually went to the gym, studied for your exam, had dinner together, or anything other habit you want to build.

Should you fail to check-in, group members are notified that you're falling behind and are asked to ping you to help get back on track. Past that, group members are removed from the group and lose their streaks.

Check-ins can be postponed by a day by spending vacation days. Every 10 check-ins earns you a vacation day.
