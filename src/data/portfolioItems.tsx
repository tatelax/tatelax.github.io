## üí° About

Sandboxr was one of the first companies that allowed anyone to create a 3D printed figurine of their favorite character from their favorite game. It was one of the very first professional freelance projects I ever worked on back in 2011.

I met with the original co-founders of Sandboxr who were interested in developing a prototype for their idea using the Unity web player. It allowed users to select models and customize the appearance to exactly how they wanted, then place their order and within a week their 3D model would be delivered to their door.

[Sandboxr was aquired by WhiteClouds in 2016.](https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/whiteclouds-announces-acquisition-sandboxr-90680/){:target="\_blank"}

## üí° About

During my time at [Process Research & Optimization (PRO)](https://processreopt.com/){:target="\_blank"}, I learned more about how large organizations struggle to maintain efficiency and how some of those inefficiencies can be solved.

I worked with various companies to help them understand their internal processes and how they can improve those processes to save time and money.

## üî• Problem

We used a variety of tools, such as [Signavio](https://www.signavio.com/){:target="\_blank"} to model a process from end-to-end, using BPMN, and run simulations to help clients understand where bottlenecks were occuring in their businesses processes. The problem with these tools, at the time, was they could not process the volume we wanted to simulate. Our clients had millions of transactions per year and the existing were unable to handle that level of volume. We also had several ideas to improve the visual aspect of these simulations to better understand what was happening and what all of the data actually meant.

## üîß Solution

I created a tool in Unity which allowed our consultants to model a business process and run 10x the number of transactions that the existing tools were able to handle. The tool also had additional features, such as being able to control the speed of the simulation which was useful for marketing purposes and allowed company stakeholders to better communicate ideas to clients. Another benefit to this tool was it's deterministic nature. Each simulation was able to output the same results each and every time whereas existing tools could vary as much as **50%** between simulations with the exact same data.

# üí° What
Associate Use Case (AUC) was an application built for Hololens 2 that enabled Walmart associates to perform the *online pickup & delivery* (OPD) process completely while wearing an XR headset.

# ‚ùì Why
Walmart associates currently use an Android based phone to perform the OPD process. They constantly needed to pick up and set down the phone in order to scan products. This reduction in efficiecy
cost Walmart millions of dollars per year.

With XR, we were able to give associates the ability to perform their duty completely hands-free. We conducted user studies to show that our tool improved their efficiency by 30%.

# üë• Who
AUC was built for the average Walmart associate. Which meant that we would be building an app for people who have never worn an XR headset.

# üìç Where
AUC was built to be used inside of a Walmart store. This presents a variety of challenges such as curious customers and slow wi-fi speeds.

# ‚ùó How
We built AUC using Unity for the Magic Leap 2.

Our biggest challenge was localization in a large indoor setting. For this, we used Azure Spatial Anchors. We also built our own tool called Store Builder that allowed us to author a digital twin of any
store.

# üí° What
This is a tool I designed and built while working for Walmart to enable our in-house cinematographer to capture real-time footage of AR content in 4K at 60 fps.

# ‚ùì Why
At Walmart, we had a constant need to show-off our work to stakeholders.

The problem is that showing Mixed Reality content to others is actually pretty difficult. There's nothing like wearing a headset to see the content first-hand, but that requires traveling to a location (such as a Walmart store), putting the headset on, and hoping for the best.

# üë• Who
This tool was built for our cinematographer to be able to capture high quality AR content on his own; with little to no work required from engineering.

# üìç Where
We primarily filmed in real-world Walmart locations. This means the setup needs to be compact to avoid getting in the way of shoppers, something that was a strict requirement from Walmart.

# ‚ùó How
We created a 3D printed bracket that allowed a Magic Leap 2 to sit on top of a Sony FX3. The Magic Leap anchored to an ArUco marker located near the shooting location and began transmitting telemetry to a laptop that was running the app we wanted to shoot.

The app was running inside the Unity editor which had a custom package installed that would emulate the user. This worked in all of our existing apps without needing any retrofitting. We were able to just drag and drop a prefab into the scene.

Then we were able to use OBS to layer the feed from the Sony FX3 on top of the output from the Unity editor. We also had an output from OBS to the monitor on the camera, allowing the cinematographer to see what he was shooting.

The ability for the cinematographer to see in real-time 4k what he was shooting enabled him to get more creative with the shoot, and understand if he's capturing what he wants in the video.

The user provided context to the LLM about their dietary goals and restrictions. The LLM was then able to make suggestions to the user about what products to buy and where to find them. We then used Vuforia for object recognition to highlight the product on the shelf for the user and tracked AR to display relevant information to the user directly on the product itself.

# üí° What

Spectator View is a tool I created for Walmart to make is fast and easy to see what a user wearing an XR
headset is seeing from a 3rd and 1st person perspective.

# ‚ùì Why

When rapidly prototyping XR apps at Walmart, we had a constant need to understand what the headset user was seeing. Here's some of the most communication
scenarios where spectating an XR user is valuable:

* Debugging issues
* Conducting user research studies to understand how users are using the app
* Product demos to stakeholders
* Helping users navigate through an XR app they are unfamiliar with
* Recording videos

# üë• Who

Spectator view is used primarily by QA testers, designers, engineers, and product managers.

* QA uses it to record footage of bugs
* Designers use it to find problematic UX issues
* Engineers use it to help diagnose issues
* Product managers use it in meetings to demonstrate to stakeholders what is being built in real-time or in pre-recorded videos


# üìç Where

Spectator view was primarily used in our mock Walmart in-office as well as in-store at a real Walmart location. Spectator view is very simple and fast to use,
which is particularly important when on-site in a Walmart store.

# ‚ùó How

1. I developed a Unity package that enabled software and QA engineers to drag and drop a prefab into the game scene. That is all that was required by engineering to
make an existing app support spectator view.

2. I developed a Spectator View iOS app that could be installed on any iOS device. An iPad was preferred due to the large screen size.

3. To begin a session, the headset wearer simply performed a specific gesture with their hands or pressed a particular button combination on a controller. This displayed a
unique ID in front of the user briefly that they could then relay to the person who wishes to spectate them.

4. The spectator then enters the ID and presses connect. The spectator can now see what the headset user sees from a first person perspective.

5. If the spectator wishes to spectate from a 3rd person perspective, they simply press the 3rd Person button and then are instructed to scan the same ArUco code
that the headset user is currently anchored to.

          description: `
# Spectate

View what the headset wearer is seeing from a first or third person perspective.


## Laser Pointer

The button in the bottom left is for the laser pointer, which can be used by pointing the iPad at the target you wish to point out to the user. This feature was particularly
useful when helping a new user get familiar with wearing an XR headset.

## Streaming & Recording

Another very useful benefit of using an iOS device is how easy it is to record the screen or even stream the entire screen while connected to a Zoom call. This enabled us to perform 
real-time demos to stakeholders with zero setup.

## üëÄ Dual Perspectives

Spectator View supports both 3rd and 1st person. This means we can see exactly what a user is seeing from their perspective, 
or we can switch to 3rd person and have a look around the scene. For example, some products required the user to interact with 
elements that were behind them. With 3rd person, we could look around the world and find elements that the user hadn't found yet.

# Benefits Over On-Device Recording

Headset like the Hololens 2 or Magic Leap 2 often experienced issues with on-device recording. However, they are often plagued with issues.
Recording video often came with it's own computational overhead which reduced framerate.

Spectator view allowed us to implement our own method of streaming video and handle recording on another device like an iPad.

          description: `
# First Person Streaming

AR footage consists of 2 video streams. One stream of the optical RGB camera on the front of the headset, and another stream of the simulated
XR content inside of Unity.

For 1st person view, I stream the RGB camera on the headset as well as a virtual camera running in the XR app over to an iPad 
which combines the streams in real-time and outputs it to the iPad user.

This allowed me to off-load some computation to an iPad instead of doing all video processing on-headset.

# Third Person Streaming

For 3rd person view, we do the same thing, but with a 2nd video camera inside the XR app that is aligned with the position of the iPad via an ArUco. 

We also calibrate the virtual camera to match the field of view of the camera on the spectator device.

Melo is a prototype I created to see what a "Figma for XR" tool could look like.

We took some inspiration from work done at my past job at Walmart to see how a user could prototype a tool that let's users visualize what a retail store could look like. Major retailers are already doing this, but in huge warehouses that are difficult to rearrange. XR makes it so 1 person could do this job in minutes instead of hours and they could even do it from the comfort of their own home if they wanted to.

They can play as a firefighter, police officer, or EMT. The game has randomized missions that occur in the game world and requires players to work together to complete those missions in a timely manner.

The game is currently in development and is being built in Unreal Engine 5.

## üí° About

A problem I've experienced on every software project I've ever been on was that we were in a constant battle to make sure we understood our user.

Does our target audience like our product?
Do they find it useful?
Do they like the design?
Do they understand the UX?

Companies spend millions of dollars every year trying to get answers to these questions. And it always happens after a product has been designed and at least prototyped by an engineer. That means you're making guesses all along the way to the answers of the above questions.

I wanted to see if AI could give companies some of these answers much sooner. And the answer is, yes...

I created a rough mockup in an hour for what the UI could look like.

Here we can see issues with accessibility that the AI has identified.

The AI is capable of idenfiying issues with poor contrast, small font sizes, and poor UX.

## üí° About

Pace is a social habit building app.

It enables you to build and maintain habits by using your friends, family, coworkers, whoever you want to help hold each other accountable.

Create a group, invite your friends, and set how many times per week everyone should check-in. Check-ins are done by taking a photo that proves you actually went to the gym, studied for your exam, had dinner together, or anything other habit you want to build.

Should you fail to check-in, group members are notified that you're falling behind and are asked to ping you to help get back on track. Past that, group members are removed from the group and lose their streaks.

Check-ins can be postponed by a day by spending vacation days. Every 10 check-ins earns you a vacation day.

New check-ins are displayed to group members where they can congratulate you as well as vote on whether your check-in is valid or not.

If enough group members vote that your check-in photo does not count, it will be reverted.
