# tatelax.github.io

This is the source-code to my personal website, [tate.sh](https://tate.sh)

It uses GitHub Pages and Jekyll.

To start a local instance, run `start.bat` or `start.sh`.

Pushing to `master` triggers an automatic deployment via a GitHub action.

Theme is a modified version of [no-style-please](https://riggraz.dev/no-style-please/) Jekyll theme.
