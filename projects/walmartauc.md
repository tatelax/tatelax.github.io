## ðŸ’¡ About

When I first joined Walmart as a Senior Software Engineer, I joined the team working on a product called "Associate Use Case" (AUC).

This is a tool we developed and tested in-store that helped associates fulfill pick-up orders. We built custom software that allowed us to author a digital twin of the entire store. This enabled us to perform navigation to help the associate find products in the store as if they had a GPS guiding them. We also used custom product recognition software to ensure that the product the associate was picking off the shelf was correct.

This tool helped improve efficiency by 20% but due to hardware costs and limitations at the time, it was not feasible for a large scale roll out.
