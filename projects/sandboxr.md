## ðŸ’¡ About

Sandboxr was one of the first companies that allowed anyone to create a 3D printed figurine of their favorite character from their favorite game. It was one of the very first professional freelance projects I ever worked on back in 2011.

I met with the original co-founders of Sandboxr who were interested in developing a prototype for their idea using the Unity web player. It allowed users to select models and customize the appearance to exactly how they wanted, then place their order and within a week their 3D model would be delivered to their door.

Sandboxr was aquired by WhiteClouds in 2016.
