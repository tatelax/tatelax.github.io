## ðŸ’¡ About

A problem I've experienced on every software project I've ever been on was that we were in a constant battle to make sure we understood our user.

Does our target audience like our product?
Do they find it useful?
Do they like the design?
Do they understand the UX?

Companies spend millions of dollars every year trying to get answers to these questions. And it always happens after a product has been designed and at least prototyped by an engineer. That means you're making guesses all along the way to the answers of the above questions.

I wanted to see if AI could give companies some of these answers much sooner. And the answer is, yes...

I created a rough mockup in an hour for what the UI could look like.
