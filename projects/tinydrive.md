## ðŸ’¡ About

Tiny Drive is a week-long project where I explored more about the current state of Augmented Reality by using AR Kit.

The game allows you to drive an RC car in augmented reality. The car is able to collide with real-world objects using the iPhone's LiDAR sensor. 

Available on the App Store soon!
