## ðŸ’¡ About

This was a 5 day hackathon project I did while working at Walmart's research division, Store. no. 8. Alongside 3 others, we built and tested in-store an app for the Magic Leap 2 that allowed users to chat with an LLM to help them choose and locate products in store.

The user provided context to the LLM about their dietary goals and restrictions. The LLM was then able to make suggestions to the user about what products to buy and where to find them. We then used Vuforia for object recognition to highlight the product on the shelf for the user and tracked AR to display relevant information to the user directly on the product itself.
