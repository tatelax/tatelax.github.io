## ðŸ’¡ About

Pace is a social habit building app.

It enables you to build and maintain habits by using your friends, family, coworkers, whoever you want to help hold each other accountable.

Create a group, invite your friends, and set how many times per week everyone should check-in. Check-ins are done by taking a photo that proves you actually went to the gym, studied for your exam, had dinner together, or anything other habit you want to build.

Should you fail to check-in, group members are notified that you're falling behind and are asked to ping you to help get back on track. Past that, group members are removed from the group and lose their streaks.

Check-ins can be postponed by a day by spending vacation days. Every 10 check-ins earns you a vacation day.
