## ðŸ’¡ About

Melo is a prototype I created to see what a "Figma for XR" tool could look like.

We took some inspiration from work done at my past job at Walmart to see how a user could prototype a tool that let's users visualize what a retail store could look like. Major retailers are already doing this, but in huge warehouses that are difficult to rearrange. XR makes it so 1 person could do this job in minutes instead of hours and they could even do it from the comfort of their own home if they wanted to.
